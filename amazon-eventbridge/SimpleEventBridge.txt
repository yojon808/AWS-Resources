This is a simple Eventbridge Lab.  
We are going to create an email notification when an EC2 instance is terminated. 

1. Create a Standard SNS topic.
    a) Then create a Subscription with the protocol set to Email. 
    b) Specify email.
    c) Check email and subscribe.

2. Next, go to Cloudtrail. 
    a) Create Trail. 
        > By default it creates a "Managment-Event" 
        > Accept default and create Trail.

3. Go to EC2 and launch instance.  
    a) Any instance, no key pair, default security group. 

4. Next, go to EventBridge and create Rule.
    a) Name the Rule, Default Event Bus, Rule with Event Pattern.
    b) Event source: "AWS events or EventBridge partner events"
    c) Scroll down to Event Pattern.  Use "AWS Services".
    d) Specify "EC2" as AWS Event. 
    e) Specify "EC2 Instance-State-Change Notification" as Event Type.
    f) Choose "Any State" or if you please specify state. 
    g) In this case specify "Any Instance". Then "Next".
    h) Target type: "AWS Service", Target: "SNS Topic", Topic: "MyEmail". Then Next.
    i) After, accept all defaults and Create Role. 

5. Test if this was succesful.  Terminate the instance and you should recieve an email about the instance change of state. 

Note:
    > Take this to the next level.
    > Trigger a Lambda event and put this info in a DynamoDB table.
    > or
    > Use this event to trigger an action.
